The Nepometer community abides by the [Nepometer code of conduct](code-of-conduct.md) on all of
communication platforms that we moderate listed below.  
Here is an excerpt from the code of conduct:

> _As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest
> of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect
> all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature
> requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches,
> and other activities._
