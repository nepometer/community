# Nepometer Community

Welcome to the Nepometer community!

This is the starting point for joining and contributing to the Nepometer community - improving docs, improving code, improving data, providing feedback etc.

## Communicating

The [communication](communication/) page lists communication channels like chat, issues, mailing lists etc.

For more specific topics, try a SIG.

## Governance

Nepometer has the following types of groups that are officially supported:

* **Committees** are named sets of people that are chartered to take on sensitive topics.
  This group is encouraged to be as open as possible while achieving its mission but, because of the nature of the topics discussed, private communications are allowed.
  Examples of committees include the steering committee and things like security or code of conduct.
* **Special Interest Groups (SIGs)** are persistent open groups that focus on a part of the project.
  SIGs must have open and transparent proceedings.
  Anyone is welcome to participate and contribute provided they follow the Nepometer Code of Conduct.
  The purpose of a SIG is to own and develop a set of **subprojects**.
  * **Subprojects** Each SIG can have a set of subprojects.
    These are smaller groups that can work independently.
    Some subprojects will be part of the main Nepometer deliverables while others will be more standalone.
    If you want to contribute design, code, algorithm or data of Nepometer, you can do by joining **Subprojects** via **SIG**
* **Working Groups** are temporary groups that are formed to address issues that cross SIG boundaries.
  Working groups do not own any code or other long term artifacts.
  Working groups can report back and act through involved SIGs.
* **User Groups** are groups for facilitating communication and discovery of information related to
  topics that have long term relevance to large groups of Nepometer users.
  They do not have ownership of parts of the Nepometer code base.
  If you want to just provide feedback about Nepometer, you can do through **User Groups**

## Contribute

A first step to contributing is to pick from the [list of nepometer SIGs](sig-list.md).
Start attending SIG meetings, join the slack channel and subscribe to the mailing list.
SIGs will often have a set of "help wanted" issues that can help new contributors get involved.

The [Contributor Guide](contributors/guide/README.md) provides detailed instruction on how to get your ideas and bug fixes seen and accepted, including:
1. How to [file an issue]
1. How to [find something to work on]
1. How to [open a pull request]
